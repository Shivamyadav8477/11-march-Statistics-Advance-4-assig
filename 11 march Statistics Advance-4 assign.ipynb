    "\n",
    "**1. Z-Test:**\n",
    "   - **Assumption:** The z-test assumes that you know the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) or have a sufficiently large sample size (typically \\(n \\geq 30\\)) where you can use the sample standard deviation (\\(s\\)) as an estimate of \\(\\sigma\\).\n",
    "   - **Use Case:** You would use a z-test when you have a large sample or when the population standard deviation is known. For example, if you want to test whether the mean height of a population is equal to a specific value (e.g., 68 inches), and you have a sample of 1000 individuals with known standard deviation, you can perform a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. T-Test:**\n",
    "   - **Assumption:** The t-test is used when the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is unknown, and you need to estimate it from the sample standard deviation (\\(s\\)). It is also appropriate for smaller sample sizes (typically \\(n < 30\\)).\n",
    "   - **Use Case:** You would use a t-test when you don't know the population standard deviation or when working with smaller sample sizes. For example, if you want to test whether a new drug reduces blood pressure, and you have a sample of 20 patients, you can perform a t-test.\n",

    "   Imagine you work for a car manufacturer, and you want to test if the average fuel efficiency of your cars matches the national average, which is known to be 30 miles per gallon. You randomly select 500 cars from your production line, and you know the population standard deviation of fuel efficiency (e.g., \\(\\sigma = 4\\)). In this case, you would use a z-test to compare your sample mean to the known population mean.\n",

    "- **T-Test Scenario:**\n",
    "   Suppose you are a nutritionist and want to determine if a new diet plan leads to a significant weight loss. You randomly select 25 individuals to follow the diet plan for two months and measure their weight before and after. Since you don't know the population standard deviation for weight loss, you use the sample standard deviation to perform a t-test to compare the mean weight loss to zero (no effect). In this case, a t-test is appropriate due to the small sample size and the lack of knowledge about the population standard deviation.\n",

    "The margin of error (MOE) in a confidence interval (CI) is a measure of the range or uncertainty around a sample statistic (usually the sample mean) that estimates the true population parameter. It quantifies the precision or accuracy of the estimate and is influenced by both the desired confidence level and the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the margin of error is related to sample size:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct Relationship with Confidence Level:** The margin of error is directly related to the desired confidence level. As you increase the confidence level (e.g., from 90% to 95% or 99%), the margin of error will also increase because you are requiring a wider range of values to be included in the interval to achieve higher confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inverse Relationship with Sample Size:** The margin of error is inversely related to the sample size. Increasing the sample size reduces the margin of error. In other words, larger samples provide more precise estimates, resulting in smaller margins of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example involving a political poll. Suppose you want to estimate the percentage of voters in a city who support a particular candidate with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 3%. Here, the margin of error is 3%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scenario 1 (Smaller Sample Size): You survey 300 voters in the city, and you find that 55% of them support the candidate. With this sample size, you have a margin of error of 3%. This means you can be 95% confident that the true percentage of voters who support the candidate falls within the range of 52% to 58%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scenario 2 (Larger Sample Size): Now, you decide to increase your sample size to 1,000 voters, keeping the same confidence level of 95%. With this larger sample size, the margin of error decreases. Let's say it's now 1.5%. This means you can be 95% confident that the true percentage of voters who support the candidate falls within the narrower range of 53.5% to 56.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a larger sample size (Scenario 2) resulted in a smaller margin of error, which means a more precise estimate of the true percentage of voters supporting the candidate. This demonstrates the inverse relationship between sample size and the margin of error: increasing the sample size leads to a more accurate and narrower confidence interval."
